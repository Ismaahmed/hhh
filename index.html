                <ol>
                    <li><span>Beat the eggs: </span>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
                    <li><span>Heat the pan:</span> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and melt the butter.</li>
                    <li><span>Cook the omelette:</span>Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs cover every surface.</li>
                    <li><span>Add fillings (optional):</span>When the eggs begin to set but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
                    <li><span>Fold and serve: </span> As the surface continues to cook, fold it in half over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then lift it onto a plate.</li>
                    <li><span>Enjoy: </span> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
